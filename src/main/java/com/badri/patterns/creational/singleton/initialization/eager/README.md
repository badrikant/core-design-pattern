**Eagerly Initialization** 

* In case if you are pretty sure that your application is going to use the atleast once the singleton object.
* We instantiate/create the object as soon as the class gets loaded into memory.
* This can be done in two ways-
    * By static block initialization 
    * By declaring as class instance
